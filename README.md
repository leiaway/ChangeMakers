IDnity

 

# Description  

Idnity is a web-based platform that is powered by AI to help individuals navigate personal, artistic, and career development, guided by the principles of Ikigai. It offers tailored recommendations, skill-building tools, and personalized roadmaps to support users in discovering and pursuing a fulfilling, purpose-driven life. Our platform integrates cutting-edge to provide users with insights into career decisions, artistic growth, and self-discovery, making it a comprehensive tool for those seeking a meaningful change. 
 

# Installation 

At this stage, IDnity is a web-based platform, so installation is not required. Users can access it through any web browser. 

 

For future mobile app development, installation details will be presented once the app is available in stores. 

 

# Usage 

First users are prompted to answer 3 open-ended questions and then, prompted to answer 5 agree/disagree questions afterward, users have the option to choose one of three pathway developments including artistic, career, and personal development. The AI process includes collecting user data, analyzing the responses, tailoring recommendations, and displaying tailored suggestions for the chosen pathway by the user.
